# QnA

### Planning

> What do you think are the greatest areas of risk in completing the project?
-No serious study or professional work in VueJS. That said, I wanted to learn it and think I did the MVP.

> What changes/additions would you make to the design?
-I didn't have alot of time for CSS, but adding additional filtering is useful such as labels, created_at, and updated_at.

> List a two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.
-Adding advanced filtering such as including labels.
-Have the issues clickable and be able to go into a new window for more detail
-Summary of all the issues in a nicer format, such as a legend/small table on right of total issues, open, closed, PRs, etc.

### Looking Back

> Describe the major design/build decisions and why you made them.
-Major decision was to use VueJS over React despite me not having much experience with it. I decided this so I wanted to learn it anyway and readme preferred it.
-Including CSS grid made it easier to show the issues in a table format.

> How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets (e.g. "Learning Framework", "Coding", "Debugging").
-8 hours
 -0.5 reading/project setup
 -1.5 learning framework
 -4 for implementing/debugging
 -1.5 CSS
 -0.5 implementing tests

> If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?
-Focus on MVP as much as possible, at times I was focusing on styling when I didn't have the MVP done yet.

> Did you learn anything new?
-Yes, I learned a whole new framework and built something that I think would be useful.

> Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?
-Generally yes, however, I'm still learning alot with Vue and want to continue learning.

> Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?
-Primarily my frontend experience has been with React/Redux as well as backend with NodeJS/Python/Django. I can work on the full stack as I have had professional experience in it.
