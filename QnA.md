# QnA

### Planning

> What do you think are the greatest areas of risk in completing the project?
- Lack of VueJS/NuxtJS experience
- Lack of GitHub API experience

> What changes/additions would you make to the design?
- Use Zeplin to communicate the design to developer instead of what's provided in the repo.
- URL at the top right is very hard to notice. Probably make it more like a page title
- Add input color for the first page (only placeholder color is provided)

> List a two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.
- Issue page
- Click label to filter by them
- Search suggestion
