# QnA

### Planning

> What do you think are the greatest areas of risk in completing the project?
- Writing an API call that handles fetching of all issues, when pagination is limited to 100 issues (consider either relying on the pagination and API when changing state, or creating an async function that calls the API multiple times until the full list of issues is fetched)
- Handling loading times and error states for the API call
- Handling different lengths and potential overflow in terms of content (title, number of tags/labels, body content)

> What changes/additions would you make to the design?
- Hover states and entrance/exit animations for the base design
- Consider incorporating borders for a bit more contrast
- Consder making the pull request icon more obvious, and creating a open and closed issue icon for consistency
- Reconsider how each card should grow/shrink based on content

> List a two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.
- A page that displays that detail of each issue
- An ability to search or filter based on tag 
- An ability for the user (ideally the repo owner) to organize and categorize the issues beyond what is available on Github

### Looking Back

> Describe the major design/build decisions and why you made them.
-

> How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets (e.g. "Learning Framework", "Coding", "Debugging").
-

> If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?
-

> Did you learn anything new?
-

> Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?
-

> Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?
