# QnA

### Planning

> What do you think are the greatest areas of risk in completing the project?

- I feel I will have trouble in the creating filter section, since it is my first time trying it out

> What changes/additions would you make to the design?

- I might change the 2nd page layout from the boxes layout to a virtically aligned bars layout.

> List a two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.

- I would add reply button so that the person who is using the app can easily join the discussion

### Looking Back

> ## Describe the major design/build decisions and why you made them.

- In the end I didn't make major changes to the design, and instead tried to build it as simple as possible, so I could focus on getting the MVP done asap.

> ## How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets (e.g. "Learning Framework", "Coding", "Debugging").

- Learning Framework: 4 hours
- Coding: 3 hours
- Debugging: 2 hours

> ## If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?

- Don't spend so much time researching on best practices, and just get to building right away. You can research what you need to along the way.

> ## Did you learn anything new?

- How Vue life-cycle methods work, and how to use them depending on each situation.
- How to build text boxes that let you submit just by hitting enter keys

> ## Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?

- Yes, I think so.

> ## Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?

- I am more comfortable with React, so if I used React I could have finsihed it quicker. (But thanks to this experience, I became much more familiar with Vue. So I am happy :) )
