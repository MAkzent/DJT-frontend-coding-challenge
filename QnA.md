# QnA

### Planning

> What do you think are the greatest areas of risk in completing the project?

- I feel I will have trouble in the creating filter section, since it is my first time trying it out

> What changes/additions would you make to the design?

- I might change the 2nd page layout from the boxes layout to a virtically aligned bars layout.

> List a two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.

- I would add reply button so that the person who is using the app can easily join the discussion

### Looking Back

> ## Describe the major design/build decisions and why you made them.

> ## How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets (e.g. "Learning Framework", "Coding", "Debugging").

> ## If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?

> ## Did you learn anything new?

> ## Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?

> ## Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?
