# QnA

### Planning

> What do you think are the greatest areas of risk in completing the project?

- I have three main areas of concern with this project. First, it will be my first time using Nuxt so getting used to all of the new functionality. Second, I've never used the GitHub issues API, so making sure I know what data I'm getting. Finally, I am pretty design focused with my frontends and falling into the trap of obsessing over every little detail. Reminding myself that this is MVP and doesn't need to be perfect helps!

> What changes/additions would you make to the design?

- There are some small things related to accessability. For example, in the nav bar, the url is not a very high contrasting color so it may be difficult for some people to read. Similarly, the icons in the issues cards for pull requests and closed issues are pretty small and could also be hard for some to see.

> List a two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.

- I think it would be nice to have the issues cards be clickable and display a modal card with the full body of the issue. Since we are potentially having the text overflow hidden, there could be some issues that you can't see the full description. Also, in the card, adding a link to the original issue would be interesting.

-

> How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets (e.g. "Learning Framework", "Coding", "Debugging").

-

> If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?

-

> Did you learn anything new?

-

> Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?

-

> Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?
