# QnA

### Planning

> What do you think are the greatest areas of risk in completing the project?

- Keeping everything responsive across all formats (worried about longer titles/descriptions)
- Filtering of all the different types of issues (pull requests, open, etc.); will depend on how easy this is to do with the github API.
- Getting all the issues to show (seems like you can only get 100 issues at a time) so will have to have a solution for that.

> What changes/additions would you make to the design?

- I think the design overall is good; it isn't too complicated and it is easy for users to see all the issues for each repo. One thing to change would be keeping the size of each card on the results page the same (Although this can be tricky with different amounts of text per result). Also perhaps making the pull requests a different color (rather than an icon) could make it easier to differentiate between an issue and a pull request.

> List a two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.

- Being able to click on issues so it would link you to the issue directly.
- Being able to put a username only into the search bar, and see the issues they've made (for any repo)

### Looking Back

> ## Describe the major design/build decisions and why you made them.

> ## How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets (e.g. "Learning Framework", "Coding", "Debugging").

> ## If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?

> ## Did you learn anything new?

> ## Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?

> ## Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?
