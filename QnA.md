# QnA

### Planning

> What do you think are the greatest areas of risk in completing the project?

- The structure
- The interaction with the API
- The rendering of the elements

> What changes/additions would you make to the design?

- The design is very similar to MD, the use of the framework could be useful
- Some of the texts have a poor contrast, e.g. the repo name in the header or the icons in the issues' cards
- Some elements could be avoided or changed due to the UX, as the X icon in the results' page
- The tag labels could've been bigger

> List a two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.

- Link to the issue URL or another application page for the showing of further infos
- Of course the pagination
- Search among the issues of an already specified repo

---

### Looking Back

> Describe the major design/build decisions and why you made them.

- Redux for hypothetical scalability
- Sass for the handling of the style in a smoother way
- modules for the style in order to keep the encapsulation
- Router for a better handling of the pages in the architecture

> How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets (e.g. "Learning Framework", "Coding", "Debugging").

- 8
- 1 learning missing topics
- 5 coding
- 2 debugging and refactoring

> If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?

- split the components earlier

> Did you learn anything new?

- improved use of thunk with redux

> Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?

- About JS it's rare to have the chance to show the knowledge of the language while using a framework. However it allows to show the building of the structure and the division of concepts. CSS and style on the contrary have been used a lot

> Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?

- The backend side of the code: NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB
- Testing
