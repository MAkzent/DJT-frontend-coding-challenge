# QnA

### Planning

> What do you think are the greatest areas of risk in completing the project?

- Keeping everything responsive across all formats (worried about longer titles/descriptions)
- Filtering of all the different types of issues (pull requests, open, etc.); will depend on how easy this is to do with the github API.
- Getting all the issues to show (seems like you can only get 100 issues at a time) so will have to have a solution for that.

> What changes/additions would you make to the design?

- I think the design overall is good; it isn't too complicated and it is easy for users to see all the issues for each repo. One thing to change would be keeping the size of each card on the results page the same (Although this can be tricky with different amounts of text per result). Also perhaps making the pull requests a different color (rather than an icon) could make it easier to differentiate between an issue and a pull request.

> List a two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.

- Being able to click on issues so it would link you to the issue directly.
- Being able to put a username only into the search bar, and see the issues they've made (for any repo)

### Looking Back

> ## Describe the major design/build decisions and why you made them.
>
> -I used the react-cli to build the project to get things going as quickly as possible. In terms of build decisions within the app, I split each major piece of the application into separate components to keep everything relatively easy to read. I originally started out using scss, but ended up mostly favoring general css as I was more comfortable with it.
>
> ## How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets (e.g. "Learning Framework", "Coding", "Debugging").
>
> I took about 4 and a half hours total of working on the project.
> -Coding (Functionality) - 1 hour and a half
> -Debugging - ~40 minutes (Had one bug that took quite a lot of time..small typo that was hard to find)
> -Styling - ~2 hours (This took the most time, to be honest i've been using a lot of CSS frameworks recently so it took a bit of time to get back into 'normal' css styling.)

> ## If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?
>
> -Just be more careful about overthinking and trying to get everything super efficient. I lost a lot of time trying to optimize certain things and I didn't quite finish the MVP so I could have gotten the time to finish in that case.

> ## Did you learn anything new?
>
> -Learning about how to shorten multi-line text was interesting! It took a bit of googling for figuring that out. I also 'learned' (remembered) how to style things well. I am not quite happy with how everything looks but I think it is relatively close to the mock so I am at least happy about that.

> ## Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?
>
> -In some ways, yes. I feel I was able to get the functionality aspect of the app done quite quickly, and I think that is where my skills shine the most. I spent a lot of time on styling and I think that is where my biggest weakness is, hence going over the time limit a bit. During my time at code chrysalis I was a lot more focused on getting features implemented rather than the styling, so I think if there was a bit more complex functionality involed in this project, it would have showcased my abilities better.

> ## Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?
>
> -Yes, considering this app is completely front-end and not deployed I wasn't able to show the fact that I can also do back-end (Setting up REST/GraphQL API's, setting up servers/endpoints, etc.) and am comfortable with querying databases whether it be a relational databases or noSQL databases. Again, I also feel the functionality aspect of this application was on the easier side, so I don't think I was able to showcase my ability in implementing more complex features.

Thank you so much for the opportunity, and regardless of the outcome this was a great and challenge and learning experience!
